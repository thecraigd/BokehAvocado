# Using Bokeh to create an interactive heatmap visualisation of avocado prices
Data visualisation project mapping price data for avocados onto a map of the USA.

There is an accompanying article on [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/creating-an-interactive-map-in-python-using-bokeh-and-pandas-f84414536a06) to walk you through this visualisation [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/creating-an-interactive-map-in-python-using-bokeh-and-pandas-f84414536a06).

This is a follow-up to this [blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/mapping-avocado-prices-in-python-with-geopandas-geopy-and-matplotlib-c7e0ef08bc26) on [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/mapping-avocado-prices-in-python-with-geopandas-geopy-and-matplotlib-c7e0ef08bc26), the code and data for which are stored in [this repository](https://github.com/thecraigd/Avocado-Prices). 

My objective here was to produce an interactive version of the static visualisation I produced previously. I used [Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/index.html) to do that, and produced [this visualisation](http://www.craigdoesdata.de/blog/avocadobokeh.html) using the code presented here.

#### Project status - Complete

## Introduction
This project was intended to allow me to experiment with using Bokeh to produce interactive maps which can be embedded in HTML pages. I was able to do that [successfully](http://www.craigdoesdata.de/blog/avocadobokeh.html).

### Methods used
* Co-ordinate transformation
* Data visualisation
* Geographical mapping

### Technologies used
* Jupyter Notebook
* pandas
* Bokeh
* Numpy


### Data Sources

Avocado price data sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/neuromusic/avocado-prices) - stored [in this repository](https://github.com/thecraigd/Avocado-Prices/blob/master/avocado.csv) as avocado.csv


### Getting started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is kept in the CSV file in the root folder of this repo.
3. All code is contained within the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/thecraigd/BokehAvocado/blob/master/Map.ipynb) for this project, stored in the root folder as Map.ipynb
